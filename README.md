# AI Chord Chart Analysis

## Project Overview

This capstone project, **AI Chord Chart Analysis**, introduces a groundbreaking Single Page Web Application (SPWA) designed to significantly enhance the iRealPro platform, a popular tool among musicians for accessing and practicing with chord charts. Traditional chord sheets, while useful, often fall short in providing comprehensive musical insights. This project aims to bridge that gap by leveraging the advanced natural language processing capabilities of ChatGPT.

The integration of ChatGPT allows musicians of any skill level to access detailed information about songs, including genre-specific performance advice, theoretical analysis, and historical context, directly from their chord sheets. This project not only addresses the disconnect between static chord sheets and dynamic musical understanding but also represents a pivotal step towards a more interactive and informed musical practice environment.

## Features

- **AI-Driven Analysis**: Provides detailed song analysis, genre-specific advice, and historical context.
- **Interactive SPWA**: A user-friendly single page web application that enhances the musician's practice experience.
- **Comprehensive Insights**: Transforms traditional chord sheets into dynamic, informative resources.
- **Modern Tech Stack**: Utilizes Python for analysis, Node.js/Express for the backend, and Svelte for the frontend.

## Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: Svelte
- **Backend**: Node.js/Express
- **AI Analysis**: Python/Node (ChatGPT integration)

## Key Benefits

- **Enhanced Practice**: Musicians receive in-depth musical insights that are traditionally unavailable in static chord sheets.
- **Informed Performance**: Provides theoretical analysis and historical context to enrich performance preparation.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: The SPWA ensures a seamless and interactive user experience.

## Future Vision

This innovative approach not only enriches the musician's practice environment by making complex theoretical concepts accessible but also paves the way for future integrations of AI technologies within the arts. It sets a new standard for how technology can support creative disciplines. Through this project, a new horizon in digital music education is envisioned, where technology acts as a bridge between the musician and the vast world of musical theory and history, facilitating a deeper understanding and appreciation of the art form.
